    "## Prediction Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this model is making the sentiment analysis based on the reviews and predicting the star that a customer will give based on the review he writes. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many sentiment analysis model using in NLP field in today's world. We tried many models based on the preprocessed data we have. The model and results are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/proposed_model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from above, the result is pretty good for deep learning model. So maybe we can build our own deep learning model by combining the advantages of existing model to make the prediction. We know that LSTM is good at dealing sequential texts and CNN is good at extracting the local features. By combining them, the result should be better than existing ones. The final model we built is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/own_model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, the first layer is the embedding layer, it can transform the reviews into word vectors. I choose the embedding size be 100, and the number of unique words is 1391195 which is also the length of original one-hot vector for word in reviews. Then I add a dropout layer for higher speed and avoiding overfitting. LSTM layer is added then, there are 4 gates and we have 32 LSTM units in this layer. After that, the output will be dealt with a 1-dimentional convolution layer. There are 64 kernels in this layer, and the kernel size is 3 to work as a tri-gram model. To extract the local feature, a max-pooling layer is added behind this layer. Then we add dropout and flat is into a fully connected layer. The last layer is softmax if we want it be a classification problem and linear if we want it be a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuarcy of this model in validation sets with 1 million samples is 0.715 for classfication. And the mean absolute error is 0.37 for regression. The result is pretty awesome and we choose as our final model.\n",

    "## Anti Click Farming\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, in today's world, click farming is very common, especially in scoring websites such as yelp. The owner may hire someone to fake as the real customers and give 5 stars to restaurant in order to increases their overall reputation. In other case, they may maliciously give their competitor worst score in order to attract the customer from their competitor to their own restaurant. Their are many ways to detect this behavior, but based on the data we have, we can only build a naive Anti Click Farming model to check it. The intuition is that many click farming software will only give fake star but randomly create a review. We know that the MAE of our model is 0.37, so if the average difference of predicted star and real star has a difference over 1, we have reason to suspect that there review and star can be inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we should notice that this system is pretty naive, we did not consider a lot of situation such as maybe the large difference is a result from the fact that many restaurants have only few reviews and scores. And we don not have the label for fake clicking, so it is hard for us to learning the feature from fake clicking. As a result, this model just a naive version and need to improve once we get more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "The final recommendation system is built based on Rshiny. The input is the business_id of the restaurant. And the output is composed of four parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The overall distribution of customer's star score. And if the average difference of predicted star and real star diverges too much, it will warn the customers.\n",
    "2. The recommendation for customers. It has two parts. The first one is the five most importance tags we extracted from the reviews. The second one is the evaluation on important business feature that extracted from the reviews. By these two parts, the customers can learn the characteristic of these restaurant and how other customers say about some important attribute of this restaurant.\n",
    "3. The suggestions to restaurant. We give the structured suggestion are customized for each restaurant. The suggestions include the things that restaurant is doing great right now and things they can improve in the future.\n",
    "4. The restaurant nearby. In this part, we will show a map that has the restaurant that nearby this restaurant. And if the user click on the mark on the map, it will show the average star, recommended tag, business id and the name of this restaurant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The app we create is on https://shuoqiang.shinyapps.io/Yelp/."
